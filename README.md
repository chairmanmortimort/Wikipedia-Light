# Wikipedia Light for Light Phone III

A calm, text-first Wikipedia reader for the Light Phone III, built with the
[Light SDK](https://github.com/lightphone/light-sdk). The **Light** variant of
the Wikipedia tool: search articles, keep a short recents list, and read —
nothing else. No Random Article, no On This Day — all in LightOS's monochrome,
distraction-free style.

This is a fork of the Light SDK repo; all tool code lives in the `tool/`
module, which is what Light's build pipeline compiles
(`./gradlew :tool:assembleRelease`).

## Status

**Early community tool — not yet Light-vetted.** As of the Light SDK's July 2026
update, there's no "easy" share path yet; Light is building the pipeline to
sign and distribute community tools. Until then, you can **sideload the debug
APK** onto a Light Phone III via ADB (Light's own docs say that's fine for the
adventurous). LightOS will warn that the tool isn't vetted — that's expected.

## What this tool does

- **Search** — look up any Wikipedia article.
- **Recents** — your last few opened articles, collapsed under a single
  "Recents" label in the bottom-left; tap it to expand the list, one tap to
  reopen (toggleable in About — turning it off hides the section entirely).
- **Article view** — readable plain-text extract with section navigation
  and the full list of related articles, each tappable.

## Settings

Accessed via the gear icon on the home screen. Toggle Show recents on or off;
clear your recent articles list. The About page carries full attribution
(content license, data source, tool).

## Screenshots

Captured on a Light Phone III running the current build:

| Home | Search | Article |

| About | Recents |

| ![About](docs/screenshots/settings.png) | ![Recents expanded](docs/screenshots/recents-expanded.png) |

## What this tool deliberately does not do

- No accounts, no tracking, no ads.
- No infinite feeds, recommendations, or "discover" surfaces — just the
  encyclopedia, the way LightOS intends tools to behave.

## Install

Download `WikipediaLight-v0.3.0-release.apk` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/chairmanmortimort/Wikipedia-Light/releases/latest)
and sideload it to your Light Phone III (Developer Options + USB debugging,
then `adb install -r WikipediaLight-v0.3.0-release.apk`).

In LightOS, allow the tool under tool settings ("Any tools" / sideload) — it'll
warn that this one isn't Light-vetted yet, which is expected for a community
build.
